Data were collected between February and August 2015 from [Project Implicit](http://projectimplicit.org).  Subjects completed the Race IAT along with demographic and background questionnaires.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
